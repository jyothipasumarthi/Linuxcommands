Delete
Delete removes the indicated text from the page and saves it into the buffer,
 the buffer being the equivalent of the "clipboard" used in Windows or Mac OSX. 
 The following table provides some common usage examples:

Action	Result
dd	    Delete current line
3dd	    Delete the next three lines
dw	    Delete the current word
d3w	    Delete the next three words
d4h	    Delete four characters to the left


Change
Change is very similar to delete;
the text is removed and saved into the buffer, 
however, the program is switched to insert mode to allow immediate changes to the text.
The following table provides some common usage examples:

Action	Result
cc	    Change current line
cw	    Change current word
c3w 	Change the next three words
c5h	    Change five characters to the left

Yank
Yank places content into the buffer without deleting it. 
The following table provides some common usage examples:

Action	Result
yy	    Yank current line
3yy	    Yank the next three lines
yw	    Yank the current word
y$	    Yank to the end of the line

Put
Put places the text saved in the buffer either before or after the cursor position. 
Notice that these are the only two options, put does not use the motions like the previous action commands.

Action	Result
p	    Put (paste) after cursor
P	    Put before cursor
